## Overview

Welcome to the IEEE Embedded System Tasks repository! This collection of tasks and projects is designed to deepen your understanding of embedded systems, focusing on platforms such as STM32 (using Neoclu) and Bluepill. In this set of tasks, you will be working on blinking LEDs using Neoclu and interfacing an LCD with a Bluepill board and much more in future.

   - [Task 3 : Bank system]

(#task-3-Bank-System)



Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- STM32 development board (e.g., Bluepill)
- STM32 IDE installed or basic toolchain info
- Toolchain for STM32 development (e.g., GCC for ARM)


## Tasks

### Task 1: Blinking LED with Neoclu

In this task, you will use Neoclu to create a simple program that blinks an LED. This exercise will familiarize you with Neoclu's integrated development environment and the basics of configuring GPIO pins for LED control.

**Instructions:** Refer to [help_1](https://github.com/NaderMohamed325/IEEE--Task/blob/main/Stm32/README.md) for detailed instructions.

### Task 2: LCD Interface with Bluepill

Explore the world of interfacing LCDs with the Bluepill STM32 board. Your objective is to display a simple message or pattern on the LCD screen.
This task will delve into the fundamentals of LCD interfacing and the STM32 GPIO configuration.
**Instructions:** Refer to [help_2](https://github.com/NaderMohamed325/IEEE--Task/blob/main/BluePill/README.md) for detailed instructions.
